# Tealeaves

This is a mod for Caves of Qud that adds a new merchant to the Stilt, named Tealeaves. It was developed over the course of about 19 hours for the [Monster Mash mod jam](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-1). Feel free to use the code here for learning or reference; everything is documented pretty well. For a full description, check the [itch.io page](https://ilysen.itch.io/caves-of-qud-tealeaves).
